The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and checked on us multiple times to make sure we had a great dining experience. The cost of our two meals was reasonable and very affordable. I would give this restaurant five stars. I would gladly return to eat here and tell all my friends and family about it."

I got the lobster roll and although it was a little smaller than I had hoped, it was still packed with lobster and delicious.  I highly recommend going there and getting the lobster roll.  It's pretty reasonably priced compared to other local restaurants as well.  It can get busy around the lunchtime hour, so going at either 11 or 1 would be best. Will go again, 100%."

The pasta I had was a little small portion wise, but the taste was great! The employees were all nice and accommodating and made the meal pleasant and enjoyable. I would definitely go again if given the chance and if I were in the local area again I would ask to go again.."

The bartender did a great job with my drinks, while the appetizers were extremely delicious. My main course, a steak with a couple of sides, was wonderfully cooked and had great flavor. :Lastly, we had some homemade Oreo cheesecake, which was so good that I did not want to stop eating it! All in all, a wonderful experience from start to finish."

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the beef was cooked and how fresh the ingredients tasted. Overall, a thumbs up recommendation from me."

They have multiple events such as live music abd trivia night. Can be very busy.  My only complaint is that prices are a bit higher , and when busy service can be a bit slower.  I bring my family here all the time and really enjoy the atmosphere and a variety of food"

It is also kids-friendly. My kids generally do not eat Chinese foods. But this time, they ate almost all their potions. I will definitely go back to the same resterarant again. The only slightly downside is that the resterrant is a little old and need some renovation. But it certainly does not affect the food and service."

The food is excellent, but what really shines to me are the service and ambiance. The restaurant's decor and atmosphere are perfect for a romantic outing or for a special occasion with friends. My family and I have taken to celebrating special occasions like anniversaries and sometimes birthdays here. The service is also second to none, with the restaurant being family-owned and operated. That sense of home and family adds to the comfortable, yet upscale, feeling of the restaurant, and I hope to see it thrive in my city for many years to come."

I am lucky enough to live within walking distance of Great Northern BBQ, and made the decision to meet a friend there who was coming in from out of town. I have been there before, but still enjoy coming back as I have never had a bad experience and this past visit did not disappoint. The brisket was perfectly tender and neither mushy nor tough, and I was impressed with the house cocktails and draft beers on offer. My friend had never been, and remarked positively on the decor and quality of service afforded to us. I would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone in Providence looking for quality barbecue at a reasonable price."

Just a spectacular experience each time my wife and I have either eaten inside or ordered take out (which literally tasted like we we're eating there mind you!) with a terrific staff. You can also really tell how much blood, sweat, and tears the owner puts out whether he's brought the food to our table or taking your order himself, also when it comes to how they select the best people to represent his brand at the cashier to the kitchen. I know it's an odd thing to say about sushi or hibachi, but this place is the destination to come to first when visiting our town. They deliver a 5-star experience at a 4-star cost and we're incredibly thankful to them for being a part of our community and also in providing a unique flavor that you cannot get anywhere around here!"

There's three tacos per plate and they're served with onions, cilantro, and radishes. Everything is made to order so expect to wait 15-20 minutes if they're busy. It's a small business and they only have outdoor seating. The seats are located under a shaded canopy, and they occasionally have live music."

The bread is soft yet still crunchy and the entree is awesome.  Finally the desert is second to none with their velvet ribbon cheesecake.  And to top it off the price is more than right. Plus the waiter was friendly and quite efficient. This is the place to go to if you want a great meal at a better price."

The owner is an elderly woman and she is the cook, waitress, and cashier all in one. The menu was typical offerings of burgers and sides. The special of the day was a seafood platter. I enjoyed it very much and found the price to be lower than the value. I reccomend Shockys highly."

One for the two of us would have been more than enough to suffice, the subs are absolutely giant! And they don't skimp you out on the meat, cheese, toppings, sauces, etc- they lay it on THICK! The menu is kind of expensive, but it's not for a sacrifice of quality or quantity- you're getting the best of both worlds. 5/5 stars, we will be going back soon."

We ordered Pho, Banh Mi, Vermicelli Noodle Salad, Fried Rice and Spring Rolls. The food came in large portions and was no-frills but tasted great! We stayed for a few hours to catch up and I definitely recommend Pho King if you're looking for a small business to support. The only downside is street-parking only so be prepared to circle a few times or park nearby."

They use only the freshest produce and have deals with local farms to source these products.  Their meats are top shelf and are all marinated in their signature blends.  Additionally, the customer service is excellent and parking is easy.  Not to forget they have a few amazing deserts."

The nachos (also pictured) had just the right amount of veggies, meat, and seasoning. The Spicy Salmon bowl was also a hit, with its tasty combination of rice, broccoli, flaky salmon, and the dressing mix. In short, it's hard to find something bad at Hungry Palate: everything will leave you wanting more!"

The staff is always so friendly and actually gives great recommendations. One of my favorite things is the size of the restaurant. One of the few places in Austin you can just show up with a large group and not need a recommendation.  The food is delicious and the portions are on the large size. I highly recommend the deluxe dinner option."

My favorite thing about the dish is that the chicken is juicy and flavorful. You get a big portion size but also get soup and a breadstick with it. Ambience can either be dark or light so caters to both vibes. Yes, wait times can be busy on the weekends, but it's worth it!"

Their sandwiches, while on the pricier side, are unmatched. Plus, they have amazing soups and salads that are the chef's kiss. I have to say that the staff are polite and positive when interacting with them. And I just love being inside, eating and just soaking in the atmosphere. Seriously, just pick almost anything off the menu; it's nearly impossible to go wrong."

Another star of the show was the unagi, which was perfectly seasoned and soft enough to melt in our mouths. The price is also extremely reasonable for an all-you-can-eat sushi place.

The flavors are fresh, and interesting, savory, juicy, the carnitas tacos were out of this world, the perfect combination of juicy and slightly crispy--totally proper. It's fun there, and good to know this city lives--without the average slop of typical (Americanized) Mexican food that all tastes the same. Look no further, Proper Taco is the best around."

The youtiao (supplemental) with the jamon and uni was a decadent bite. The supplemental lobster dish was good but not great and the sauce was broken, so that is not a must-add to your meal. For the wines, I choseStephen Regnault Lydien No 62- expressive and balanaced with brioche and lots of pear and some floral elements"

I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something to eat on the go. I've been craving Mexican food and its hard to come by carne asada fries in the area. Something I truly miss about Southern California but, thankfully now we have it here! They have tons of other amazing items and everything I've tried on the menu is absolutely delicious. Once again I highly recommend this location!"

Service is good, but not amazing.  Drinks are tasty as well.  I would recommend it for a casual lunch, or for dinner with family, but not necessarily for a nice dinner between a couple.  The decor is lacking a bit, and could use some updating.  But one plus is that there is plenty of available parking, and there are other stores nearby (it is in a mini-shopping area that also includes a supermarket)"

Additionally their hot tea is the best thing to drink while visiting here as their sodas are canned. Staff is very expeditious, friendly, and unobtrusive. They never have a long wait to be seated, though occasionally there is a long wait to receive your order from the kitchen."

Our server, David was very nice and explained all the meat before grilling for us. The sauces were great too and I love the Sam Jang. I could dip anything in that sauce and it would still taste good. I chose the combo and not the all you can eat option because it had better selection of meats and it was still a lot! I will go back again for sure."

One time my spouse ordered his usual which is the burrito amigo, it comes with rice and beans inside the burrito.  He forgot and asked for fries instead of beans.  When they brought it out, there weren't any fries.  We asked our waiter and he went to find out.  My spouse cut into his burrito and the cook had actually replaced the beans inside the burrito with the fries.  The waiter came back and we all had a good laugh.   My spouse said the burrito was good like that."

Top notch seafood selections set this place apart, wide variety of table salsas, never an issue with preparation.

Despite the super-busy Friday night atmosphere, service staff was ON IT and having fun. Kitchen had it going on with the flavors somehow even tastier than usual. I'd put this night at the little divey restaurant up against any fine dining experience I've ever had."

It's difficult to see very far down the road when pulling out. I appreciate Linda and Chris and Teresa and all of the stuff that I have met over the years. I always get a biscuits and gravy I think it's really good. For breakfast I typically do the grilled cheeseburger and the onion rings. It's also really great for groups."

The Margaritas were great and the food was delicious.  It was happy hour, so the drinks were discounted. When the check arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how little it was. The service was excellent. I highly recommend checking this place out."

I had chicken Alfredo which was so good without substituting any ingredients, it was the best Alfredo I ever had. The salad was the best salad with a perfect ranch dressing. At the end of the visit, I was so glad I spent the money (which was quite overall). Overall, it is a place I would like to go again."

They go out of your way to be speedy and efficient. They are kind and understanding. They also welcome kids with open arms. This is my favorite brunch location!"

The vibe was nice and cozy inside, the place was on the smaller side but didnt feel cramped at all. The wait staff was welcoming and helpful with recommending items from the menu. The food itself was amazing, i got a burger and mixed fries, it was so deliciously flavorful, and appealing to the eyes as well. Overall the food was great, staff was fantastic and the building itself provides the perfect backdrop for a nice meal. I would recommend the place to any and everyone!"

I had it with a glass of cold milk. The price was also very cheap at $10 for a full pie. I would definitely get this pie again when I go back. It reminds me of the hershey pie that Burger King has but it tastes much better and the servings are way bigger."

Short waiting times for seating, although one cannot book beforehand. Food is dished up attractively and garnished with fresh products. Food arrives warm and with clean plates and cutlery. There is a huge range of items to choose from to suit everyone's taste. They have starters on the menu that include fish dishes and vegetable starters. "

For whatever reason, this review needs to be unnecessarily longer despite the fact that no one cares. Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary. Applesauce comes in a plastic container. Eat here. This is completely ridiculous. Longer sentences do not make people write more. Paper cups are made of paper. My door is open. This has been an authentic experience. Remember to eat at Little Cat if you are ever in town. The town is located by a train that makes periodic noises at random times and is apparently trained for ridiculous tasks to train people who don't readily speak English."

I find their chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken to be a very large portion and perhaps more heavily breaded than I prefer, although I just pull some of it off if I don't feel like eating it. I recently got a fish sandwich to go, and it was very good and we were more than satisfied. Nice people, although sometimes service can be slower than desired because it can get busy."

I would also recommend checking out their Calzones.  The service is warm and friendly and has that small town atmosphere, with attentive service. The place is small but also very clean and orderly and makes a nice little hang out area. Everything is really affordable with a ton of value for your money, so you also can't really beat that aspect.

The pizza was great as usual from the pepperoni to the Hawaiian. Everyone came away happy with the pizza. The service was friendly and efficient. They even through in a little birthday surprise for our daughter and she was very excited. We could not ask for more. Thanks Pizza Boy!"

It is an all you can eat buffet. They have a variety of mexican food that you get when you first get there and go through the line, picking your food you would like. Once you sit down and eat, if you are ready for more, instead of going back to the line that have a Mexican flag on a small rope that you raise and the waitress comes to you and takes your orders of what else you will like. Right before we get our receipt they give us a basket of sopapilla's and honey! We love it!"

I ended up ordering their squid noodle soup which I got spicy since they let you customize the heat level. When I sat down by the window and opened up my order, it was still warm and jam packed with squid, vegetables like bok choy and peppers and slurp-worthy noodles. The squid was tender and the broth was flavorful while still delivering on the heat."

The food was also incredible, with the exception of one dish. But that dish was just a disagreeing preference of flavors."

The food is always served hot and fresh, never sitting under a heat lamp.  The last time I was there, I ordered the Texas Scramble.  It was delicious!  The eggs weren't runny, and the meat had a nice kick to it. The portion was quite large.  I'm a big eater and still needed a take home box as I couldn't finish what was served to me.  I was served within 10 minutes of placing my order.  Highly recommended!"

Drink service was quick, the beers were ice cold, the bartenders were friendly and they had baseball on their huge TVs. Service is fast, you just grab a tray and pick your food, your sides and sit anywhere you want. They have a few delicious flavors of their BBQ sauce and their wings are just $1 each for their all day wing happy hour on Saturday. Great spot to spend the afternoon eating BBQ and watching the game with a friend. We left just before it got more crowded in the afternoon."

They accepted us as a walk-in (no reservation) even though we were a group of 4 people, and we were seated almost instantly. The chefs are always fun and will usually have fun with the entire table by tossing an egg in their hat, trying to toss vegetables in your mouth with the spatula, etc. Two of us ordered the steak hibachi and requested it to be cooked medium rare, and the steak came out perfectly. The other two got teriyaki chicken, which I have tried previously, and it was also great. The portions for the sides are also huge, so you won't have to worry about leaving on an empty stomach (I wasn't even able to finish all of it). I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for hibachi in the area."

It has a great breakfast option, which includes coffee, with eggs, toast, potatoes and meat for $6.49. Then we also go around 5pm on Fridays for their fish dinner for $10.99, which is a bit pricey because it's gone up 5 dollars since we moved to this area 6 years ago. But, all in all, we love it, we know all the servers and we can customize about everything we want because we all know each other."

The energy  of this place led us back here just last week. This time we ate on their outside patio. The staff was different, but they were just as friendly as the people a few months ago. The food was great again. There was a different DJ. He mashed up music that you wouldn't think would go together, but he knew what he was doing. He did a great job.

The food was great (as always) but it wasn‚Äôt the best experience. We came to celebrate a big milestone, but our lunch was kind of a disappointment. I still like this place overall, but I hope it improves. Food is always great though. Brunch, lunch or dinner, I would recommend any of it."

The ingredients are high quality and will not have the sweet flavor that is present in chain pizzarias. Furthermore, the pizzaria is located in the Italian district of Boston, so it cannot be argued that it is authentic. Give this a try, I guarantee it is better than any pizzas you've had in the past."

Located in Brooklyn, the facade doesn't give the restaurant any justice.  The inside is a beautiful home feeling. The provides comfort while you enjoy your meal. This restaurant is a must try.  You will love each bite.  I recommend the margarita pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil.  They also have a lovely steak with an amazing sauce. I am surprised this is not a Michelin restaurant  "

A nice place for a date, not the kind of place you'd eat lunch every day though due to smaller portions and costly total bills for what you get. But it IS very good coffee and tacos, just a bit small for the bucks you will spend on them. I took my adult daughter for a daddy-daughter lunch because she lives in that neighborhood but I would likely not go there for any other reason because of the parking hassle and general expense for the small portions."

My most recent trip was a takeout order. I ordered what I normally order, which is the chicken fried chicken dinner. It comes with two sides and rolls. I enjoyed my dinner quite a bit, but there have been some changes with Elijah's in recent years. They have downsized their portion sizes, and of course it is more expensive to eat there. Despite those minor changes, Elijah's Caf√© remains one of my go to places to eat."

The best thing I like about this place is the portion sizes are small, so you can try all the different types of sushi. Some sushi places make their sushi incredibly huge and stuffed with a lot of rice, leaving you with only one or two rounds and you're done. At Sake 2 Me, we went around 7-8 rounds before we had to call it quits, which left us feeling very full and happy.

The meat had those perfectly crispy edges that just snap when you bite in, and the flavor combo was so well-balanced. I didn't even think about adding extra sauce or anything. You could really tell everything was made with care, like not rushed, and not slapped together, just done right. The Space had his cool, gritty-yet-artsy vibe - kinda like industrial meets street art - it just felt chill, like a place where you could bring a friend or even your kid and both be happy. I waited a little while for the food, and they were out of fries, which I'll admit threw me at first, but when that burger hit the table, all was forgiven. The staff were kind and grounded too - no fake energy, just good folks doing what they love. I left full, happy, already thinking about the next time I come back."

I knew Island Way Grill would be the best because they have their own fishing boats which Catch the freshest local fish. The night we went was Red snapper stuffed with crab.Our waiter Was very knowledgeable and attentive,He recommended some sushi as an appetizer which was Delicious.We got the early bird special which was $25 a person so it was a great deal!I would highly recommend Island Way Grill if you are coming to Clearwater!"

The servers are friendly and responsive. Parking can be a bit of an issue when you go during busier times just due to location. This is not their fault though, so it is hard to be annoyed about it. It can also get a little crowded inside when there are a lot of groups or parties."

We chose a sampler platter and a few different entrees. Everything got to the table hot. The quality of the food was amazing! Curry is perfectly seasoned, fried foods golden, and every sauce was delicious. Highly recommend sharing the experience to trade and try as many different things as possible.

My girlfriend also enjoyed her sushi, which is super helpful for her because of her dietary restrictions.  The wait staff was very nice and the view was beautiful as always!  Looking forward to coming back again soon."

The staff members were absolutely amazing and positive. They even gave me a free side of fries with my pizza! I recommend visiting at least once in your lifetime. I would a thousand percent visit again for the delicious pizza and great service."

I have also made dear friends there that were also customers. We think of it as a second home. The guys behind the sushi bar are hilarious and always up for a good roast. This also comes with complimentary noodles while you wait!"

My wife got the squash agnolotti and I got the wild boar papardelle which was straight baller. We ended up being too full for dessert at the time, so we got a passion fruit semifreddo for the walk down to the theater. All in all, another 5 star meal at Grist."

The cashier was very pleasant and made for a great experience at Al's. The chicken sandwich I got was to die for. Overall a great experience."

The wait for takeout is somewhat long, but its fine since this is the most quality Asian cuisine in a 10 mile radius.   I'd recommend Mongolian Beef, General Tso and any of the lo mein's or fried rice to begin, then move on to the other dishes. Everything is hot, the cooks are so sweet, one personally brought out my order.   Visit them sometime, you won't regret it."

Once seated, it doesn't take long for a waiter to come to your table. Usually there are not a lot of waiters working but they are all very efficient and friendly.

The fish itself is always fresh and juicy and never tastes fishy. They also have an amazing coleslaw, potato wedges and hush puppies that come with it all homemade in house. You can even get it as an all you can eat meal if your feeling real hungry. They even have other seafood options for people that don't care much for catfish."

The cheese sticks were also perfectly cooked. It was an excellent meal and I would love to order another one in the future. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a very good meal and anyone who enjoys pizza with lots of cheese. Door dash delivered it and they were nice and friendly. They got the order to me right away once it was ready."

We ended up taking most of the food home for dinner tomorrow. We can't wait to visit again when we are in town!"

They have a very warm and inviting atmosphere for families and kids of all ages. They provide coloring stuff for the kiddos and complimentary chips and salsa. The staff is very warm and friendly. They are quick about taking your order and bringing the drinks. They check on you just enough to make sure no one needs anything with out hovering. They have a well rounded variety of food for the picky eaters, to the ones that like more complex dishes, also choices for vegetarians and ones trying to eat healthier. They usually get your order right the first time and when they do make a mistake they are quick to make it right. I really appreciate all they do to give the best restaurant experience possible. 10/10 Will be back with my family!!"

It is a lovely atmosphere at Leader, with an industrial, Scandinavian feeling to the surroundings.  The food is delicious and we very much enjoyed our meal."

What really makes them unique is they have 5 types of pickles to choose from and all vegetables are very fresh.  You can watch them cut the veggies right in front of you.  Another cool thing they do is season fries to order, so if you really want to go downtown to flavor town they will put a lot of seasoning on for you.  They also have great quality chicken that is good as a sandwich, chicken fried steak, or tenders. Its an amazing spot that not a lot of people know about, much better than fast food or chain restaurants."
