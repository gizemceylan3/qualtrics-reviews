The food and drinks are delicious, the vibe is immaculate. The staff is lovely as always. Would definitely recommend the boozy latte to drink & the chicken sandwich to eat! They have tons of beers on tap as well as a fun cocktail menu as well - theres options for everyone. A true 10/10 as always!"

The atmosphere was calm and relaxed, and they had sports on a muted TV behind the sushi bar. We really liked it, and I will be returning!"

Everything is fresh and made to order. Most importantly, the people that work there are very nice! Everyone smiles and greets you with a warm welcome. I think everybody should give Scubbers a try because you're definitely missing out if you don't."

We were greeted as soon as we entered, seated quickly, and got our food in no time. The food was fantastic and exceeded our expectations. They also have an extensive wine selection. The food was on the higher end cost wise, but the whole experience made it worthwhile. We will defiantly make this a regular spot for special occasions and gatherings. Highly recommended."

My wife and I always go for tacos here and can never resist getting a margarita as well. Everything always tastes great! The restaurant is somewhat dimly lit, giving it a nice, relaxed atmosphere. The music is not too loud so it gives you a chance to enjoy a conversation. My kids love it too and can always find something on the menu to enjoy."

Unless you have the abilities of a snake to unhinge your jaw to swallow your prey whole, you might struggle eating these sandwiches. They are delicious though and worth the effort. The shop was surprisingly dead, I usually go during lunch and it is always so busy. Prices are rough, but I do usually get two meals out of the deal."

Their pastas are all made in house and you can really taste the difference with them. Now of course the name is CRUST and their pizzas have some of the lightest most airy freshest crusts I've ever had. No matter what food you order, they really knock it out of the park. Oh, don't forget the garlic knots too. They're typically packed at peak times so use their online call ahead function to save time.

Somebody pinch me, this can't be real.  Additionally, the service was fast and friendly. They were attentive, checked on me a few times to make sure everything was good, and this really just made it one of the better dining out experiences I've had in many years.

Coconut, lemon and chocolate pies with fresh coffee is a reason in itself to visit Valley Country Restaurant. I highly recommend Valley Country Restaurant."

We started with the crab cakes, which were crispy on the outside and tender inside, definitely a highlight.  For the main course, I ordered the grilled salmon with lemon butter sauce and roasted seasonal vegetables. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the veggies were vibrant and well-seasoned. My friend had the duck confit, which was rich and flavorful, though a bit heavy.  Service was warm and attentive, though the kitchen seemed a bit backed up, it took about 40 minutes to get our entrees, which is why I‚Äôm giving 4 stars instead of 5.

My favorite dish was the chicken parm, many places try but cannot perfect it like them. Their cheese and marinara sauce is what I have searching for. You cannot go wrong with any dish though! I also like the friend mozzarella as an appetizer."

The food was done in record time and it was so delicious. It really felt like our waitress loved her job and it showed in the high quality of service we were given. We didn't have to wait long for our bill. They have the option to sit outside on the patio or you can sit inside and have a beautiful view of the city and the gold course. The bar area is fun and inviting, but they also have it separate from rest of the restaurant so if that's not your vibe, you don't have to be around it. I had the raviolis and spaghetti meal and the noodles and the rest of the food was done perfectly.  The whole experience was amazing!"

I recently went to order some food for me and my mom. She was so happy to get out of the house. The owners were so kind to my mom while we waited for our food.

Their food all has that homemade, family recipe taste. The diner itself is small with limited indoor seating and a staff of only a few people. During busy times, it can feel a little crowded, but it is well worth it. The french toast and waffles are to die for, and their lunch specials are definitely worth checking out."

I couldn't make up my mind with so many menu choices, but finally decided on the loaded barbeque baked potato.

She was attentive and friendly, quickly bringing us our drink order and helping us determine which items were allergy-safe to accommodate our daughter's peanut and egg allergy. The pizzas we ordered and onion strings appetizers came out from the kitchen promptly with enough time to savor the appetizer before the pizzas were served.

There is a salsa bar as well.  No table service just pick up your food when they call your number.  Only gave it a 4 star because it could be a little cleaner inside.  Also, they have a lot of drinks that are traditional that you would find in Mexico."

We asked to be sat in the bar area so we could watch the tvs because two games were on that we wanted to see and \"E\" not only sat us in the bar, but asked us to wait two minutes and he went and cleaned a specific table, sat us at it and said that table was the best one for watching the tvs. E then also waited on us and he was the BEST server I've ever had and I was a server for 20 years.  He was so patient, kind and funny.  We didn't know til we were done that we walked in ten minutes before closing!  We felt beyond horrible and apologized profusely.  Had we known we would've left and went elsewhere.  Unlike other places where if you go in close to closing time, the staff is rude and rush you, E did the complete opposite.  He even told us to take our time.  Again, E was phenomenal.  I cant stress that enough.  We will absolutely be going back if E is there to wait on us."

The staff was really nice and attentive. We both had pasta dishes, but there was a paella available, and other dishes. I had the chicken tetrazini and my wife had a dish with marinara. The food really was top notch overall.   I highly recommend it if you're looking for something different in the Kennewick area of Washington."

I had the roasted rosemary chicken that was very flavorful. The vegetable choices were nice as well. Nothing was too salty nor bland. The service was very welcoming. I didn't feel like just another customer. I would Highly reccommend trying this establishment if you are in the area."

I have seen a handful of ex NBA players eating there as they live nearby which speaks to it's quality.  They are locally owned and seem to have a very small amount of staff that is there nearly every day with little turn over as they treat them like family which creates a very welcoming place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner."

The flour tortillas are super soft and fluffy. The chicken for the chicken fajitas has a yummy marinade that tastes like it has orange juice in it. I always ask for a side of shredded cheese and it really completes my meal, as it's salty and the heat from the cast iron makes it a bit creamy. I really appreciate that they make super sweet tea at this restaurant too, for us Southerners."

The servers are attentive and the food is crazy good.  I usually get the chicken but the seafood is also just insanely good.  We go there often for date nights and its the place I bring everyone from out of town to when they come to visit."

The pies and cakes looked decadent as well, and were on display at the front. We tried the chocolate cake and it was very moist and tasty. The place is not crowded but not empty, just the right amount of people to get fast service and also feel comfortable about not being alone in the restaurant. Definitely try this place, it's a great mom and pop restaurant and it will not disappoint!"

Breakfast is always amazing and some of the best bacon and eggs in town. Their French toast is delicious!! If you are in the mood for lunch, they have great burgers and sandwiches too. It is one of the most affordable and tasty cafe's in East Dallas. The staff is welcoming and has no problems with customizing your order."

Funnily, I don't eat seafood but the roast chicken and the pasta are worth repeat orders. Everyone in my party was happy and sated and between them ordered nearly every seafood dish on the menu plus a premier plateau. Dessert isn't my favorite, so I can't judge it. Food just tastes better with a sea breeze!"

The menu features all the normal breakfast favorites as well as some fun specials. We ordered strawberry-covered pancakes and eggs benedict, and the food came quickly and was absolutely delicious.

The menu as a whole is affordable, and their lasagna is the best I've had. It's super cheesy and comes in aluminum, making sure it says hot for as long as possible. They also have plenty of sides and create-your-own pizzas, strombolis, and calzones, making something for everyone here."

They also offer tripa tacos (pig intestine tacos) that are delicious. I say ask for your tripa tacos to be crispy for the best taste.

This is very much a buffet that has 50 items and only 5 of them are worthwhile. It's located in a very far part of town. Still, the facilities are clean and even if the sushi is left out a little too long in the early day, at least the bathrooms were fine."

The mac was cheesy but not too cheesy, the skin on the chicken was delicious. I will definitely go back to try some other things, the greens looked amazing but I didn't get to try them."

With any of the different types of meats, veggies, and salsas, the servers were helpful to explain the types of food.

As a Salvadoran restaurant, that heritage was put first in everything that that the establishment offered, from the decorations to the food. All of the food tasted incredibly authentic and were rich with the sorts of flavors that you can usually only find traveling in Latin America. I was particularly impressed by the quality of the pupusas, and everyone in my family who tried them really enjoyed them. This is seriously a restaurant that you shouldn't miss out on if you have any experience with Latin America, although I would recommend having at least one member of your party be conversational in Spanish because there was only one waiter on the floor who was able to take orders in English."

The staff were very friendly, and the prices were reasonable. We enjoyed lots of delicious food for not a lot of money. Frankie's is one of the best Italian restaurants in town and is especially favored by us because of the value."

Some of the menu items can be kind of pricey, but the amount of food that you get is worth it."

We ordered the bulgogi plus $5 extra icy nangmyeon... the nangmyeon was so delicious and a large portion for the $5. The bulgogi was a bit dry but very flavorful.

I like the attentiveness of the staff, and they were very accommodating, especially to my one friend who has a seafood allergy. The decor was very nice and traditional, and the place had a lively atmosphere. At the end they gave us fortune cookies, and we had so many leftovers, it was great for the value in comparison to the price. Highly recommend this place!"

The staff is always responsive and pleasant, the atmosphere is pitch perfect and most importantly the food is always exact and perfect. If you are new to Indian food try the ridiculously affordable lunch time buffet if you can. For dinner though the options are endless, but I like to stick to the classics: Chicken Tikka Masala, for which the restaurant can't be beat."

Their pad Thai is cooked authentically, wrapped in an egg, and their Khao Soi is similar to what you can find in Chiang Mai. My personal favorite is Kra Pao - it's a blend of ground beef with a spicy chile oil, with rice and a fried egg - very similar to what you can find in Thailand. The prices are high, but they are worth it due to the volume of food you can get. Its a mixture of fine dining that actually leaves you feeling full and satisfied.  "

My favorite style for the chicken is Nashville Hot dry rub seasoning. The service from the servers and bartenders is fantastic and the place with all its TVs is huge and fun."

The fries were great too, I'm pretty sure they were doubled fried so they were very crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.

The menu is extensive and exotic with choices not commonly available. Although the name seem to imply that the restaurant is a noodle place, there are so many other types of offerings. The noodles are all hand made!  The services provided are prompt and efficient. The food was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely come back again."

You could eat it like that and be perfectly happy. Or you can add some veggies that they give you for free. They gave me a nice serving of lettuce, tomatoes and some avocado, when I added that all in the tortilla the sincronizada got even bigger. It swelled up by like 50 percent so i got fuller even faster. The sauces were good too, not too spicy. The place is always clean and the people there are very friendly."

Besides that, the casual hibachi experience was usually pretty entertaining for me with how masterfully skilled the cooks are when it comes to displaying and performing how they cook our meals. Another thing that I really liked about the whole thing is that a lot of the stuff in their menu are pretty affordable and have a decent variety to them with the given options. Like they give you the option to pick the hibachi style meal or just a readily made entree for you to choose from, and I like that they give you the choice to do so. It's a Japanese restaurant so don't really expect any type of menu outside that scope, but even then like I said, the variety and the diverse choices they have on the menu makes it a very worthwhile experience for me. I would love to come back some time besides the food, the interior of the place is very nice and gives you a calming experience."

The sauce was rich and flavorful and the toppings were tasty. Service was friendly and the food was great. I had initially planned to take my pizza to go, but I decided to dine in the restaurant. It was easy to find a place to sit. I'll return soon for sure!"

That was the case with my recent visit to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse, and I can say without hesitation, five stars from start to finish.  We arrived just after the lunch rush and were seated immediately. The host was friendly and efficient, and within moments of sitting down, our server Jasmine greeted us with a genuine sense of hospitality. Our food arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious. Piping hot, flavorful and exactly what I wanted after a long morning of meetings."

The chips and salsa were fresh along with the food we ordered was tasty. The server was friendly and kind with offering recommendations. We also received free desert for my birthday, which was a nice surprise. Overall, Don Patron quickly became one of my favorite places to go."

We were seated quickly and our server was super friendly and helpful helping us with the menu. We decided to try a couple apps, one was the octopus, which the server recommended and also some falafel.  Both were great.  We each ordered something different for our entrees and everything looked amazing.  Everyone really enjoyed our meals.  Can't wait to go back!"

The staff is really warm and friendly and you feel like you are part of your community dining here. The food is hot and fresh here as well! The crawfish is the best and I would recommend that because it is hot and spicy. If you want something less spicy for your littles the staff can make adjustments to the recipe. However, if you are looking for some good Louisiana cooking in Texas definitely the spot.  The restaurant is nice and clean with a causal ambiance. Come in with your kids or a date night. It feels very homey and it smells wonderful in there."

If you are thinking about trying this place out, go ahead and give it a try. Go on Saturday when they have extra food! Only reason I have given a 4 star review instead of a 5 is because they don't seem to clean very often and the food was mushy."

The ambiance feels like a throwback to a 1920s speakeasy, creating a sense of both intimacy and sophistication. The service is attentive without being overbearing, and the staff clearly knows the menu inside and out. The star of the meal is obviously the steak - perfectly seared, seasoned, and cooking exactly to order but the sides like the truffle max and mushrooms are so flavorful they almost steal the show."
